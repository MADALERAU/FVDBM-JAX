# Introduction
This documentation serves as the API for the finite volume discrete Boltzmann method (FVDBM) solver developed in Jax.
All methods and docstring added in the codebase are automatically updated and added to the API.

**Guide**

The src module contains all core components of the FVDBM solver, with additional utility functions located in the utils module.

## Getting Started
To be completed...

# Contributing
This section outlines procedures and guides for future contributions to the codebase.
## Docstring Guide
The docscrings utilized in the API uses a formatting language called [Markdown](https://markdownguide.org).
All files, classes, methods, etc should contain some form of a docstring guide.

Additionally, method docstrings should utilize the following format:

```
Class/Method Description
___
**Parameters:**
- **arg1** (Type): arg1 description
- **arg2** (Type): arg2 description

**Returns:** return description
___
**Examples**

Description
```
